Pls see the KM doc I wrote for Oracle when I worked there
"How to Decrypt and View SSL Snoop Data With Wireshark for Oracle iPlanet Web Server (Doc ID 1455999.1)"

simply speaking
1/ get the rsa private keys from the SSL web server 
2/ format it to pkcs12 export format
3/ import it into wireshark
4/ start capture the SSL tcpdump data packets and then stop when done
5/ configure wireshark to read the RSA private key 
6/ read the decrypted contents 

ref: https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures
then search for "SSL with decryption keys"

"SSL with decryption keys
File: snakeoil2_070531.tgz 
Description: Example of SSL encrypted HTTPS traffic and the key to decrypt it. (example taken from the dev mailinglist)
